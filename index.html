                <p>If I could give Born a Crime a new title, it would beat“ Identity During Apartheid”. The word
                    “Identity” describes finding out who you are. ”Apartheid was a system of racial segregation enforced
                    by the white minority government in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. The reason that “Identity During
                    Apartheid” would be the title of the book is because of apartheid it was difficult for Trevor to
                    have an answer to “who am I?”
                    He was born to a white father, Robert, and his mother, Patricia, which didn’t fit into the
                    government's laws. The book shows his struggle with this. The word “Apartheid” puts the story in a
                    specific time and place, so readers can easily know what kind of challenges Trevor faced.



                </p>
                <p>
                    Trevor Noah's description of his step-father: "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional
                    wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because
                    his dream is to put her in a cage.'”, shows that Abel wants a traditional wife but only falling for
                    independent women with the goal of controlling, and taking away their freedom. Even now, there are
                    people who think similar to Abel. They believe that men should be the strong providers and women
                    should focus on home and family.



                </p>
                <p>
                    Like Abel, some people fall in love with someone who is a smart, independent, and successful woman.
                    However, that excitement is confused with a desire to control. They might try to limit their
                    partner's freedom, get jealous of their success, or expect them to be more traditional and dependent
                    women. People who have this mindset say they want equal partnership but still expect their partner
                    to do most of the housework. It shows a contradiction: wanting freedom but wanting a cage.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In some cases, there are women that believe in differentiating roles based on gender. There are
                    mothers that raise their children as they fit with that idea, which makes the daughters later be
                    okay with not having freedom as a woman. Then the idea can be passed from generation to generation,
                    which could lead the whole community to adapt to the perception of separating roles based on gender.



                </p>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, true love and partnership should be about celebrating each other’s freedom. What I
                    have learned from “Born a Crime” is that women can be more successful than men, because Trevor's
                    mother, Patricia, achieved things that Abel couldn’t achieve. So being successful doesn’t depend on
                    someone's gender, but it depends on someone's hard.

                        <p>“The genius of apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on
                            each
                            other. Apart hate, is what it was. You separate people into groups and make them hate one
                            another so you can run them all.”</p>

                            that going to get me? People always lecture the poor: ‘Take responsibility for yourself!

                            something of yourself!’ But with what raw materials are the poor to make something of
